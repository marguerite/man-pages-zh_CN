.SH DESCRIPTION
openSUSE build service command-line tool.

.SS COMMANDS
.TP
\fBadd\fR
Mark files to be added upon the next commit

In case a URL is given the file will get downloaded and registered to be downloaded
by the server as well via the download_url source service.

This is recommended for release tar balls to track their source and to help
others to review your changes esp. on version upgrades.

usage:
    osc add URL [URL...]
    osc add FILE [FILE...]

.TP
\fBaddchannels\fR
Add channels to project.

The command adds all channels which are defined to be used for a given source package. 
The source link target is used to lookup the channels. The command can be
used for a certain package or for all in the specified project.

In case no channel is defined the operation is just returning.

Examples:
    osc addchannels [PROJECT [PACKAGE]]
Options:
    \-h, \-\-help  show this help message and exit
    \-e, \-\-enable\-all
                Enable all added channels including the ones disabled
                by default.
    \-s, \-\-skip\-disabled
                Skip disabled channels. Otherwise the source gets
                added, but not the repositories.


.TP
\fBaddremove (ar)\fR
Adds new files, removes disappeared files

Adds all files new in the local copy, and removes all disappeared files.

ARG, if specified, is a package working copy.

Usage:
    osc addremove [ARGS...]

Options:
    \-h, \-\-help  show this help message and exit
    \-r, \-\-recursive
                If CWD is a project dir then scan all package dirs as
                well


.TP
\fBaggregatepac\fR
"Aggregate" a package to another package

Aggregation of a package means that the build results (binaries) of a
package are basically copied into another project.
This can be used to make packages available from building that are
needed in a project but available only in a different project. Note
that this is done at the expense of disk space. See
http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Tips_and_Tricks#link_and_aggregate
for more information.

The DESTPAC name is optional; the source packages' name will be used if
DESTPAC is omitted.

usage:
    osc aggregatepac SOURCEPRJ SOURCEPAC DESTPRJ [DESTPAC]
Options:
    \-h, \-\-help  show this help message and exit
    \-d, \-\-disable\-publish
                disable publishing of the aggregated package
    \-m SRC=TARGET[,SRC=TARGET], \-\-map\-repo=SRC=TARGET[,SRC=TARGET]
                Allows repository mapping(s) to be given as
                SRC=TARGET[,SRC=TARGET]
    \-\-nosources
                ignore source packages when copying build results to
                destination project


.TP
\fBapi\fR
Issue an arbitrary request to the API

Useful for testing.

URL can be specified either partially (only the path component), or fully
with URL scheme and hostname ('http://...').

Note the global \-A and \-H options (see osc help).

Examples:
  osc api /source/home:user
  osc api \-X PUT \-T /etc/fstab source/home:user/test5/myfstab
  osc api \-e /configuration

Usage:
    osc api URL 

Options:
    \-h, \-\-help  show this help message and exit
    \-a NAME STRING, \-\-add\-header=NAME STRING
                add the specified header to the request
    \-T FILE, \-f FILE, \-\-file=FILE
                specify filename to upload, uses PUT mode by default

\fBbranch (bco, branchco, getpac)\fR
Branch a package

[See http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Collaboration
for information on this topic.]

Create a source link from a package of an existing project to a new
subproject of the requesters home project (home:branches:)

The branched package will live in
    home:USERNAME:branches:PROJECT/PACKAGE
if nothing else specified.

With getpac or bco, the branched package will come from one of
    openSUSE:Factory
(list of projects from oscrc:getpac_default_project)
if nothing else is specfied on the command line.

In case of branch errors, where the source has currently merge
conflicts use \-\-linkrev=base option.

                where a package is developed)


.TP
\fBbuild\fR
Build a package on your local machine

You need to call the command inside a package directory, which should be a
buildsystem checkout. (Local modifications are fine.)

The arguments REPOSITORY and ARCH can be taken from the first two columns
of the 'osc repos' output. BUILD_DESCR is either a RPM spec file, or a
Debian dsc file.

The command honours packagecachedir, build-root and build-uid
settings in .oscrc, if present. You may want to set su-wrapper = 'sudo'
in .oscrc, and configure sudo with option NOPASSWD for /usr/bin/build.

If neither \-\-clean nor \-\-noinit is given, build will reuse an existing
build-root again, removing unneeded packages and add missing ones. This
is usually the fastest option.

If the package doesn't exist on the server please use the \-\-local\-package
option.
If the project of the package doesn't exist on the server please use the
\-\-alternative\-project <alternative-project> option:
Example:
    osc build [OPTS] \-\-alternative\-project openSUSE:10.3 standard i586 BUILD_DESCR

usage:
    osc build [OPTS] REPOSITORY ARCH BUILD_DESCR
    osc build [OPTS] REPOSITORY ARCH
    osc build [OPTS] REPOSITORY (ARCH = hostarch, BUILD_DESCR is detected automatically)
    osc build [OPTS] ARCH (REPOSITORY = build_repository (config option), BUILD_DESCR is detected automatically)
    osc build [OPTS] BUILD_DESCR (REPOSITORY = build_repository (config option), ARCH = hostarch)
    osc build [OPTS] (REPOSITORY = build_repository (config option), ARCH = hostarch, BUILD_DESCR is detected automatically)

# Note:
# Configuration can be overridden by envvars, e.g.
# OSC_SU_WRAPPER overrides the setting of su-wrapper.
# OSC_BUILD_ROOT overrides the setting of build-root.
# OSC_PACKAGECACHEDIR overrides the setting of packagecachedir.

.TP
\fBbuildconfig\fR
Shows the build config

Shows the build configuration which is used in building a package.
This command is mostly used internally by the 'build' command.

The returned data is the project-wide build configuration in a format
which is directly readable by the build script. It contains RPM macros
and BuildRequires expansions, for example.

The argument REPOSITORY an be taken from the first column of the
 'osc repos' output.

usage:
    osc buildconfig REPOSITORY                      (in pkg or prj dir)
    osc buildconfig PROJECT REPOSITORY

.TP
\fBbuildhistory (buildhist)\fR
Shows the build history of a package

The arguments REPOSITORY and ARCH can be taken from the first two columns
of the 'osc repos' output.

usage:
   osc buildhist REPOSITORY ARCHITECTURE
   osc buildhist PROJECT PACKAGE REPOSITORY ARCHITECTURE
Options:
    \-h, \-\-help  show this help message and exit

    \-\-csv       generate output in CSV (separated by |)


.TP
\fBbuildinfo\fR
Shows the build info

Shows the build "info" which is used in building a package.
This command is mostly used internally by the 'build' subcommand.
It needs to be called from within a package directory.

The BUILD_DESCR argument is optional. BUILD_DESCR is a local RPM specfile
or Debian "dsc" file. If specified, it is sent to the server, and the
buildinfo will be based on it. If the argument is not supplied, the
buildinfo is derived from the specfile which is currently on the source
repository server.

The returned data is XML and contains a list of the packages used in
building, their source, and the expanded BuildRequires.

The arguments REPOSITORY and ARCH are optional. They can be taken from
the first two columns of the 'osc repos' output. If not specified,
REPOSITORY defaults to the 'build_repositoy' config entry in your '.oscrc'
and ARCH defaults to your host architecture.

usage:
    in a package working copy:
        osc buildinfo [OPTS] REPOSITORY ARCH BUILD_DESCR
        osc buildinfo [OPTS] REPOSITORY (ARCH = hostarch, BUILD_DESCR is detected automatically)
        osc buildinfo [OPTS] ARCH (REPOSITORY = build_repository (config option), BUILD_DESCR is detected automatically)
        osc buildinfo [OPTS] BUILD_DESCR (REPOSITORY = build_repository (config option), ARCH = hostarch)
        osc buildinfo [OPTS] (REPOSITORY = build_repository (config option), ARCH = hostarch, BUILD_DESCR is detected automatically)
        Note: if BUILD_DESCR does not exist locally the remote BUILD_DESCR is used

    osc buildinfo [OPTS] PROJECT PACKAGE REPOSITORY ARCH [BUILD_DESCR]

Options:
    \-h, \-\-help  show this help message and exit
    \-p DIR, \-\-prefer\-pkgs=DIR

.TP
\fBbuildlog (bl, blt, buildlogtail)\fR
Shows the build log of a package

Shows the log file of the build of a package. Can be used to follow the
log while it is being written.
Needs to be called from within a package directory.

When called as buildlogtail (or blt) it just shows the end of the logfile.
This is useful to see just a build failure reasons.

The arguments REPOSITORY and ARCH are the first two columns in the 'osc
results' output. If the buildlog url is used buildlog command has the
same behavior as remotebuildlog.

Usage:
    osc buildlog [ARGS...]

[REPOSITORY ARCH | BUILDLOGURL]

.TP
\fBcheckout (co)\fR
Check out content from the repository

Check out content from the repository server, creating a local working
copy.

When checking out a single package, the option \-\-revision can be used
to specify a revision of the package to be checked out.

When a package is a source link, then it will be checked out in
expanded form. If \-\-unexpand\-link option is used, the checkout will
instead produce the raw _link file plus patches.

usage:

Mark files or package directories to be deleted upon the next 'checkin'

usage:
    cd .../PROJECT/PACKAGE
    osc delete FILE [...]
    cd .../PROJECT
    osc delete PACKAGE [...]

This command works on check out copies. Use "rdelete" for working on server
side only. This is needed for removing the entire project.

As a safety measure, projects must be empty (i.e., you need to delete all
packages first).

If you are sure that you want to remove a package and all
its files use '\-\-force' switch. Sometimes this also works without \-\-force.

Options:
    \-h, \-\-help  show this help message and exit

The command dependson and whatdependson can be used to find out what
will be triggered when a certain package changes.
This is no guarantee, since the new build might have changed dependencies.

dependson shows the build dependencies inside of a project, valid for a
given repository and architecture.
NOTE: to see all binary packages, which can trigger a build you need to
      refer the buildinfo, since this command shows only the dependencies
      inside of a project.

The arguments REPOSITORY and ARCH can be taken from the first two columns
of the 'osc repos' output.

usage in package or project directory:

\fBmbranch (maintained, sm)\fR
Search or branch multiple instances of a package

This command is used for searching all relevant instances of packages
and creating links of them in one project.
This is esp. used for maintenance updates. It can also be used to branch
all packages marked before with a given attribute.

[See http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Concept_Maintenance
for information on this topic.]

The branched package will live in
    home:USERNAME:branches:ATTRIBUTE:PACKAGE

.TP
\fBmeta\fR
Show meta information, or edit it

Show or edit build service metadata of type <prj|pkg|prjconf|user|pattern>.

This command displays metadata on buildservice objects like projects,
packages, or users. The type of metadata is specified by the word after
"meta", like e.g. "meta prj".

prj denotes metadata of a buildservice project.
prjconf denotes the (build) configuration of a project.
pkg denotes metadata of a buildservice package.
user denotes the metadata of a user.
pattern denotes installation patterns defined for a project.

To list patterns, use 'osc meta pattern PRJ'. An additional argument
will be the pattern file to view or edit.

With the \-\-edit switch, the metadata can be edited. Per default, osc
opens the program specified by the environmental variable EDITOR with a
temporary file. Alternatively, content to be saved can be supplied via
the \-\-file switch. If the argument is '\-', input is taken from stdin:
osc meta prjconf home:user | sed ... | osc meta prjconf home:user \-F \-

When trying to edit a non-existing resource, it is created implicitly.


Examples:
    osc meta prj PRJ
    osc meta pkg PRJ PKG
    osc meta pkg PRJ PKG \-e

Usage:
    osc meta <prj|pkg|prjconf|user|pattern> ARGS...

Uses the project/package of the current directory if none of
\-M, \-U USER, project/package are given.

"log" will show the history of the given ID

"show" will show the request itself, and generate a diff for review, if
used with the \-\-diff option. The keyword show can be omitted if the ID is numeric.

"decline" will change the request state to "declined"

"reopen" will set the request back to new or review.

"setincident" will direct "maintenance" requests into specific incidents

"supersede" will supersede one request with another existing one.

"revoke" will set the request state to "revoked"

"accept" will change the request state to "accepted" and will trigger
the actual submit process. That would normally be a server-side copy of
the source package to the target package.

"checkout" will checkout the request's source package ("submit" requests only).

"priorize" change the prioritity of a request to either "critical", "important", "moderate" or "low"
