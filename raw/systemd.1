.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems\&. When run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system that brings up and maintains userspace services\&.
.PP
For compatibility with SysV, if systemd is called as
\fBinit\fR
and a PID that is not 1, it will execute
\fBtelinit\fR
and pass all command line arguments unmodified\&. That means
\fBinit\fR
and
\fBtelinit\fR
are mostly equivalent when invoked from normal login sessions\&. See
\fBtelinit\fR(8)
for more information\&.
.PP
When run as system instance, systemd interprets the configuration file
system\&.conf, otherwise
user\&.conf\&. See
\fBsystemd-system.conf\fR(5)
for more information\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are understood:
.PP
\fB\-\-test\fR
.RS 4
Determine startup sequence, dump it and exit\&. This is an option useful for debugging only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-dump\-configuration\-items\fR
.RS 4
Dump understood unit configuration items\&. This outputs a terse but complete list of configuration items understood in unit definition files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-unit=\fR
.RS 4
Set default unit to activate on startup\&. If not specified, defaults to
default\&.target\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-system\fR, \fB\-\-user\fR
.RS 4
For
\fB\-\-system\fR, tell systemd to run a system instance, even if the process ID is not 1, i\&.e\&. systemd is not run as init process\&.
\fB\-\-user\fR
does the opposite, running a user instance even if the process ID is 1\&. Normally it should not be necessary to pass these options, as systemd automatically detects the mode it is started in\&. These options are hence of little use except for debugging\&. Note that it is not supported booting and maintaining a full system with systemd running in
\fB\-\-system\fR
mode, but PID not 1\&. In practice, passing
\fB\-\-system\fR
explicitly is only useful in conjunction with
\fB\-\-test\fR\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
Dump core on crash\&. This switch has no effect when run as user instance\&.

.SH "CONCEPTS"
.PP
systemd provides a dependency system between various entities called "units" of 12 different types\&. Units encapsulate various objects that are relevant for system boot\-up and maintenance\&. The majority of units are configured in unit configuration files, whose syntax and basic set of options is described in
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5), however some are created automatically from other configuration, dynamically from system state or programmatically at runtime\&. Units may be "active" (meaning started, bound, plugged in, \&.\&.\&., depending on the unit type, see below), or "inactive" (meaning stopped, unbound, unplugged, \&.\&.\&.), as well as in the process of being activated or deactivated, i\&.e\&. between the two states (these states are called "activating", "deactivating")\&. A special "failed" state is available as well, which is very similar to "inactive" and is entered when the service failed in some way (process returned error code on exit, or crashed, or an operation timed out)\&. If this state is entered, the cause will be logged, for later reference\&. Note that the various unit types may have a number of additional substates, which are mapped to the five generalized unit states described here\&.

\fBsystemd.scope\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
Units are named as their configuration files\&. Some units have special semantics\&. A detailed list is available in
\fBsystemd.special\fR(7)\&.
.PP
systemd knows various kinds of dependencies, including positive and negative requirement dependencies (i\&.e\&.
\fIRequires=\fR
and
\fIConflicts=\fR) as well as ordering dependencies (\fIAfter=\fR
and
\fIBefore=\fR)\&. NB: ordering and requirement dependencies are orthogonal\&. If only a requirement dependency exists between two units (e\&.g\&.
foo\&.service
requires
bar\&.service), but no ordering dependency (e\&.g\&.
foo\&.service
after
bar\&.service) and both are requested to start, they will be started in parallel\&. It is a common pattern that both requirement and ordering dependencies are placed between two units\&. Also note that the majority of dependencies are implicitly created and maintained by systemd\&. In most cases, it should be unnecessary to declare additional dependencies manually, however it is possible to do this\&.
.PP
Application programs and units (via dependencies) may request state changes of units\&. In systemd, these requests are encapsulated as \*(Aqjobs\*(Aq and maintained in a job queue\&. Jobs may succeed or can fail, their execution is ordered based on the ordering dependencies of the units they have been scheduled for\&.
.PP
On boot systemd activates the target unit
default\&.target
whose job is to activate on\-boot services and other on\-boot units by pulling them in via dependencies\&. Usually the unit name is just an alias (symlink) for either
graphical\&.target
(for fully\-featured boots into the UI) or
multi\-user\&.target
(for limited console\-only boots for use in embedded or server environments, or similar; a subset of graphical\&.target)\&. However, it is at the discretion of the administrator to configure it as an alias to any other target unit\&. See
\fBsystemd.special\fR(7)
for details about these target units\&.
.PP
Processes systemd spawns are placed in individual Linux control groups named after the unit which they belong to in the private systemd hierarchy\&. (see
\m[blue]\fBcgroups\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
for more information about control groups, or short "cgroups")\&. systemd uses this to effectively keep track of processes\&. Control group information is maintained in the kernel, and is accessible via the file system hierarchy (beneath
/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/), or in tools such as
\fBps\fR(1)
(\fBps xawf \-eo pid,user,cgroup,args\fR
is particularly useful to list all processes and the systemd units they belong to\&.)\&.
.PP
systemd is compatible with the SysV init system to a large degree: SysV init scripts are supported and simply read as an alternative (though limited) configuration file format\&. The SysV
/dev/initctl
interface is provided, and compatibility implementations of the various SysV client tools are available\&. In addition to that, various established Unix functionality such as
/etc/fstab
or the
utmp
database are supported\&.
.PP
systemd has a minimal transaction system: if a unit is requested to start up or shut down it will add it and all its dependencies to a temporary transaction\&. Then, it will verify if the transaction is consistent (i\&.e\&. whether the ordering of all units is cycle\-free)\&. If it is not, systemd will try to fix it up, and removes non\-essential jobs from the transaction that might remove the loop\&. Also, systemd tries to suppress non\-essential jobs in the transaction that would stop a running service\&. Finally it is checked whether the jobs of the transaction contradict jobs that have already been queued, and optionally the transaction is aborted then\&. If all worked out and the transaction is consistent and minimized in its impact it is merged with all already outstanding jobs and added to the run queue\&. Effectively this means that before executing a requested operation, systemd will verify that it makes sense, fixing it if possible, and only failing if it really cannot work\&.
.PP
Systemd contains native implementations of various tasks that need to be executed as part of the boot process\&. For example, it sets the hostname or configures the loopback network device\&. It also sets up and mounts various API file systems, such as
/sys
or
/proc\&.
.PP
For more information about the concepts and ideas behind systemd, please refer to the
\m[blue]\fBOriginal Design Document\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&.
.PP
Note that some but not all interfaces provided by systemd are covered by the
\m[blue]\fBInterface Stability Promise\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2\&.
.PP
Units may be generated dynamically at boot and system manager reload time, for example based on other configuration files or parameters passed on the kernel command line\&. For details see the
\m[blue]\fBGenerators Specification\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2\&.
.PP
Systems which invoke systemd in a container or initrd environment should implement the

System unit directories
.RS 4
The systemd system manager reads unit configuration from various directories\&. Packages that want to install unit files shall place them in the directory returned by
\fBpkg\-config systemd \-\-variable=systemdsystemunitdir\fR\&. Other directories checked are
/usr/local/lib/systemd/system
and
/usr/lib/systemd/system\&. User configuration always takes precedence\&.
\fBpkg\-config systemd \-\-variable=systemdsystemconfdir\fR

.RS 4
Similar rules apply for the user unit directories\&. However, here the

\fBpkg\-config systemd \-\-variable=systemduserunitdir\fR\&. Global configuration is done in the directory reported by
\fBpkg\-config systemd \-\-variable=systemduserconfdir\fR\&. The

\fIsystemd\&.show_status=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument or the constant

\fBtrue\fR, shows terse service status updates on the console during bootup\&.
\fBauto\fR
behaves like
\fBfalse\fR
until a service fails or there is a significant delay in boot\&. Defaults to
\fBtrue\fR, unless
\fBquiet\fR
is passed as kernel command line option in which case it defaults to
\fBauto\fR\&.

\fIquiet\fR
.RS 4
Turn off status output at boot, much like
\fIsystemd\&.show_status=false\fR
would\&. Note that this option is also read by the kernel itself and disables kernel log output\&. Passing this option hence turns off the usual output from both the system manager and the kernel\&.

\fIdebug\fR
.RS 4
Turn on debugging output\&. This is equivalent to
