<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para><command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
is an implementation of Kernighan and Bentley's language for
typesetting graphs, as described in &ldquo;Grap-A Language for Typesetting
Graphs, Tutorial and User Manual,&rdquo; by Jon L. Bentley and Brian W.
Kernighan, revised May 1991, which is the primary source for
information on how to use
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
As of this writing, it is available electronically at 
<literal>http://www.kohala.com/start/troff/cstr114.ps</literal>.
Additional documentation and examples, packaged with
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
may have been installed locally as well.  If available, paths to them
can be displayed using
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
<option>-h</option>
or 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
<option>-v</option>
(or 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
<option>--help</option>
/
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
<option>--version</option>)</para>

<para>This version is a black box implementation of 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
and some inconsistencies are to be expected.  The remainder of this
manual page will briefly outline the
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
language as implemented here.</para>

<para><command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
is a 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
pre-processor.  It takes commands embedded in a 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>troff</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
source file which are surrounded by 
<command remap='Ic'>.G1</command>
and
<command remap='Ic'>.G2</command>
macros, and rewrites them into 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
commands to display the graph.
Other lines are copied.  Output is always to the standard output,
which is usually redirected.  Input is from the given
<replaceable>filename</replaceable>,s
which are read in order.  A 
<replaceable>filename</replaceable>
of 
-
is the standard input.
If no 
<replaceable>filename</replaceable>s
are given, input is read from the standard input.</para>

<para>Because
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
is a 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
preprocessor, and GNU 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
will output TeX, it is possible to use
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
with TeX.</para>

<para>The 
<option>-d</option>
option specifies a file of macro definitions to be read at startup,
and defaults to /usr/local/share/grap/grap.defines .
The
<option>-D</option>
option inhibits the reading of any initial macros file
(the
<option>-l</option>
flag is a synonym for 
<option>-D</option>,
though I do not remember why).  The defines
file can also be given using the 
<envar>GRAP_DEFINES</envar>
environment variable. (See below).</para>

<para><option>-v</option>
prints the version information on the standard output and exits.
<option>--version</option>
is a synonym for 
<option>-v</option>.</para>

<para><option>-u</option>
makes labels unaligned by default.  This version of 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
uses new features of GNU 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
to align the left and right labels with
the axes, that is that the left and right labels run at right angles
to the text of the paper.  This may be useful in porting old 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
programs.
<option>-c</option>
makes plot strings unclipped by default.  Some versions of 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
allow users to place a string anywhere in the coordinate space, rather than
only in the frame.  By default this version of 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
does not plot any string centered outside the frame.  
<option>-c</option>
allows strings to be placed anywhere.  See also the 
<command remap='Ic'>clipped</command>
and 
<command remap='Ic'>unclipped</command>
string modifiers described in the
<command remap='Ic'>plot</command>
statement.</para>

<para><option>-M</option>
is followed by a colon-separated list of directories used to search
for relative pathnames included via 
<command remap='Ic'>copy</command>.
The path is also used to locate the defines file, so if the 
<option>-d</option>
changes the defines file name to a relative name, it will be searched
for in the path given by 
<option>-M</option>.
The search path always includes the current directory, and by default
that directory is searched last.</para>

<para>All numbers used internally by 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
are double precision floating point values.  Sometimes using floating point
numbers has unintended consequences.  To help avoid these problems,
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
can use two thresholds for comparison of floating point numbers, set by
<option>-R</option>
or 
<option>-r</option>.
The 
<option>-R</option>
flag sets coarse comparison mode, which is suitable for most applications.  If
you are plotting small values &ndash; less than 1e-6 or so &ndash; consider using
<option>-r</option>
which uses very fine comparisons between numbers.  You may also want to rescale your plotted values to be larger in magnitude. The coarse comarisons are
used by default.</para>

<para>To be precise, the value by which two numbers must differ for 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
to consider them not equal is called the comparison limit and the smallest
non-zero number is called the minimum value.  The values a given version of 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
uses for these are included in the output of
<option>-v</option>
or 
<option>-h</option>.</para>

<para>All
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
commands are included between 
<command remap='Ic'>.G1</command>
and
<command remap='Ic'>.G2</command>
macros, which are consumed by 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
The output contains 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
between
<command remap='Ic'>.PS</command>
and
<command remap='Ic'>.PE</command>
macros.  Any arguments to the
<command remap='Ic'>.G1</command>
macro in the input are arguments to the
<command remap='Ic'>.PS</command>
macro in the output, so graphs can be scaled just like 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
diagrams.
If 
<option>-C</option>
is given, any macro beginning with .G1 or .G2 is treated as a .G1 or
.G2 macro, for compatibility with old versions of troff.  Using 
<option>-C</option>
also forces pure troff syntax on embedded font change commands when strings
have the
<command remap='Ic'>size</command>
attribute, and all strings to be 
<command remap='Ic'>unclipped</command>.</para>

<para>The 
<option>-h</option>
flag prints a brief help message and exits.  
<option>--help</option>
is a synonym for
<option>-h</option>.</para>

<para>It is possible for someone to cause 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
to fail by passing a bad format string and data to the
<command remap='Ic'>sprintf</command>
command.  If 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
is integrated as part of the printing system, this could conceivably
provided a path to breaching security on the machine.  If you choose to
use 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
as part of a printing system run by the super-user, you should disable
<command remap='Ic'>sprintf</command>
commands.  This can be done by calling 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
with the 
<option>-S</option>
flag, setting the
<envar>GRAP_SAFER</envar>
environment variable, or compiling with the GRAP_SAFER preprocessor
symbol defined.  (The GNU configure script included with
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
will define that preprocessor symbol if the
<option>--with-grap-safe</option>
option is given.)</para>

<para>The 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
commands are sketched below.  Refer to Kernighan and Bentley's paper
for the details.</para>

<para>New versions of
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>groff</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
will invoke 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
if 
<option>-G</option>
is given.</para>

This describes how the axes for the graph are drawn. A
<replaceable>line_description</replaceable>
is a 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
line description, e.g., 
<literal>dashed</literal>
<literal>0.5</literal>,
or the literal
<literal>solid</literal>.
It may also include a 
<command remap='Ic'>color</command>
keyword followed by the color to draw the string in double quotes.  Any color
understood by the underlying groff system can be used.  Color can only be used
under GNU pic, and is not available in compatibility mode.  Similarly, for 
pic implementations that understand
<command remap='Ic'>thickness</command>,
that attribute may be used with a real valued parameter.  
<command remap='Ic'>Thickness</command>
is not available in compatibility mode.</para>

<para>If the first 
<replaceable>line_description</replaceable>
is given, the frame is drawn with that style.  The default is 
<literal>solid</literal>.
The height and width of the frame can also be specified in inches.
The default line style can be over-ridden for sides of the frame by
specifying additional parameters to
<command remap='Ic'>frame</command>.</para>

<para>If no plotting commands have been given before the 
<command remap='Ic'>frame</command>
command is issued, the frame will be output at that point in the
plotting stream relative to embedded 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>troff</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
or
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
commands.  Otherwise the frame is output before the first plotted
object (even invisible ones).</para>

<para><command remap='Ic'>ht</command>
and
<command remap='Ic'>wid</command>
are in inches by default, but can be any
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>groff</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
unit.  If omitted, the dimensions are 2 inches high by 3 inches wide.</para>

<para><command remap='Ic'>coord</command>
<replaceable>name</replaceable>
<command>x</command> <replaceable>expr</replaceable>, <replaceable>expr</replaceable>
<command>y</command> <replaceable>expr</replaceable>, <replaceable>expr</replaceable>
[<command>log</command> <command>x</command> &verbar; <command>log</command> <command>y</command> &verbar; <command>log</command> <command>log</command>]
The
<command remap='Ic'>coord</command>
command specifies a new coordinate system or sets limits on the
default system.  It defines the largest and smallest values that can
be plotted, and therefore the scale of the data in the frame.  The
limits for the x and y coordinate systems can be given separately.  If
a 
<replaceable>name</replaceable>
is given, that coordinate system is defined, if not the default system
is modified.</para>

<para>A coordinate system created by one 
<command remap='Ic'>coord</command>
command may be modified by subsequent 
<command remap='Ic'>coord</command>
commands.  A
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
program may declare a coordinate space using
<command remap='Ic'>coord</command>,
<command remap='Ic'>copy</command>
a file of data through a macro that plots the data and finds its
maxima and minima, and then define the size of the coordinate system
with a second 
<command remap='Ic'>coord</command>
statement.</para>

<para>This command also determines if a scale is plotted logarithmically.  
<command>log</command> <command>log</command>
means the same thing as 
<command>log</command> <command>x</command> <command>log</command> <command>y</command>.</para>

<para><command remap='Ic'>draw</command>
<replaceable>line_name</replaceable>
<replaceable>line_description</replaceable>
<replaceable>plot_string</replaceable>
The
<command remap='Ic'>draw</command>
command defines the style with which a given line will be plotted.  If
<replaceable>line_name</replaceable>
is given, the style is associated with that name, otherwise the
default style is set.  
<replaceable>line_description</replaceable>
is a 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
line description, and the optional
<replaceable>plot_string</replaceable>
is a string to be centered at each point.  The default line
description is
<literal>invis</literal>,
and the default plotting string is a centered bullet, so by default
each point is a filled circle, and they are unconnected.
If points are being connected, each
<command remap='Ic'>draw</command>
command ends any current line and begins a new one.</para>

<para>When defining a line style, that is the first 
<command remap='Ic'>draw</command>
command for a given line name, specifying no plot string means that
there are to be no plot strings.  Omitting the plot string on
subsequent 
<command remap='Ic'>draw</command>
commands addressing the same named line means not to change the plot
string.  If a line has been defined with a plot string, and the format
is changed by a subsequent
<command remap='Ic'>draw</command>
statement, the plot string can be removed by specifying "" in the
<command remap='Ic'>draw</command>
statement.</para>

<para>The plot string can have its format changed through several string_modifiers.
String_modifiers are described in the description of the 
<command remap='Ic'>plot</command>
command.</para>

<para>The standard defines file includes several macros useful as plot strings, 
including 
<command remap='Ic'>bullet</command>,
<command remap='Ic'>square</command>,
and
<command remap='Ic'>delta</command>.</para>

<para><command remap='Ic'>new</command>
is a synonym for 
<command remap='Ic'>draw</command>.</para>

<para><command remap='Ic'>next</command>
<replaceable>line_name</replaceable>
<command>at</command>
<replaceable>coordinates_name</replaceable>
<replaceable>expr</replaceable>, <replaceable>expr</replaceable>
<replaceable>line_description</replaceable>
The 
<command remap='Ic'>next</command>
command plots the given point using the line style given by
<replaceable>line_name</replaceable>,
or the default if none is given.  If
<replaceable>line_name</replaceable>
is given, it should have been defined by an earlier
<command remap='Ic'>draw</command>
command, if not a new line style with that name is created,
initialized the same way as the default style.  The two expressions
give the point's x and y values, relative to the optional coordinate
system.  That system should have been defined by an earlier
<command remap='Ic'>coord</command>
command, if not, grap will exit.  If the optional
<replaceable>line_description</replaceable>
is given, it overrides the style's default line description.  You
cannot over-ride the plotting string.  To use a different plotting
string use the 
<command remap='Ic'>plot</command>
command.</para>

<para>The coordinates may optionally be enclosed in parentheses: 
(<replaceable>expr</replaceable>, <replaceable>expr</replaceable>)</para>

<replaceable>expr</replaceable>
<replaceable>format_string</replaceable>
<command>at</command>
<replaceable>coordinates_name</replaceable>
<replaceable>expr</replaceable>, <replaceable>expr</replaceable>
These commands both plot a string at the given point.  In the first
case the literal strings are stacked above each other.  The string_modifiers
include the
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
justification modifiers 
, (<command remap='Ic'>ljust</command>
<command remap='Ic'>rjust</command>,
<command remap='Ic'>above</command>,
and
<command remap='Ic'>below</command>),
and absolute and relative
<literal>size</literal>
modifiers.  See the
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
documentation for the description of the justification modifiers.
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
also supports the 
<command remap='Ic'>aligned</command>
and
<command remap='Ic'>unaligned</command>
modifiers which are briefly noted in the description of the 
<command remap='Ic'>label</command>
command.</para>

<para>The standard defines file includes several macros useful as plot strings, 
including 
<command remap='Ic'>bullet</command>,
<command remap='Ic'>square</command>,
and
<command remap='Ic'>delta</command>.</para>

<para>Strings placed by either format of the 
<command remap='Ic'>plot</command>
command are restricted to being within the frame.  This can be overridden by
using the 
<command remap='Ic'>unclipped</command>
attribute, which allows a string to be plotted in or out of the frame.  The 
<option>-c</option>
and 
<option>-C</option>
flags set 
<command remap='Ic'>unclipped</command>
on all strings, and to prevent a string from being plotted outside the frame
when those flags are active, the 
<command remap='Ic'>clipped</command>
attribute can be used to retore clipping behavior.  Though 
<command remap='Ic'>clipped</command>
or 
<command remap='Ic'>unclipped</command>
can be applied to any string, it only has meaning for 
<command remap='Ic'>plot</command>
statements.</para>

<para><literal>size</literal>
<replaceable>expr</replaceable>
sets the string size to 
<replaceable>expr</replaceable>
points.  If 
<replaceable>expr</replaceable>
is preceded by a + or -, the size is increased or decreased by that
many points.</para>

<para>If 
<command remap='Ic'>color</command>
and a color name in double quotes appears, the string will be rendered in that
color under a version of GNU troff that supports color.  Color is not available
in compatibility mode.</para>

<para>In the second version, the 
<replaceable>expr</replaceable>
is converted to a string and placed on the graph.  
<replaceable>format_string</replaceable>
is a 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>printf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
format string.  Only formatting escapes for printing
floating point numbers make sense.  The format string is only respected
if the 
<command remap='Ic'>sprintf</command>
command is also active.  See the description of 
<command remap='Ic'>sprintf</command>
for the various ways to disable it.  
<command remap='Ic'>Plot</command>
and 
<command remap='Ic'>sprintf</command>
respond differently when 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
is running safely.  
<command remap='Ic'>Sprintf</command>
ignores any arguments, passing the format string through without
substitution. 
<command remap='Ic'>plot</command>
ignores the format string completely, plotting
<replaceable>expr</replaceable>
using the 
"%g"
format.</para>

<para>Points are specified the same way as for 
<command remap='Ic'>next</command>
commands, with the same consequences for undefined coordinate systems.</para>

<para>The second form of this command is because the first form can be used
with a
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
<command remap='Ic'>sprintf</command>
expression (See
<link  linkend='expressions'>Expressions</link>).</para>

This command controls the placement of ticks on the frame.  By
default, ticks are automatically generated on the left and bottom
sides of the frame.</para>

<para>The first version of this command turns on the automatic tick
generation for a given side.  The 
<command>in</command>
or
<command>out</command>
parameter controls the direction and length of the ticks.  If a 
<replaceable>coord_name</replaceable>
is specified, the ticks are automatically generated using that
coordinate system.  If no system is specified, the default coordinate
system is used.  As with
<command remap='Ic'>next</command>
and
<command remap='Ic'>plot</command>,
the coordinate system must be declared before the 
<command remap='Ic'>ticks</command>
statement that references it.  This syntax for requesting
automatically generated ticks is an extension, and will not port to
older 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
implementations.</para>

<para>The second version of the
<command remap='Ic'>ticks</command>
command overrides the automatic placement of the ticks by specifying
a list of coordinates at which to place the ticks.  If the ticks are
not defined with respect to the default coordinate system, the
<replaceable>coord_name</replaceable>
parameter must be given.  For each tick a 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>printf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
style format string can be given.  The
<replaceable>format_string</replaceable>
defaults to
"%g".
The format string can also take string modifiers as described in the 
<command remap='Ic'>plot</command>
command.
To place ticks with no labels, specify 
<replaceable>format_string</replaceable>
as
"".</para>

<para>If 
<command remap='Ic'>sprintf</command>
is disabled, 
<command remap='Ic'>ticks</command>
behaves as
<command remap='Ic'>plot</command>
with respect to the format string.</para>

<para>The labels on the ticks may be shifted by specifying a direction and
the distance in inches to offset the label.  That is the optional
direction and expression immediately preceding the 
<command>at</command>.</para>

<para>The third format of the 
<command remap='Ic'>ticks</command>
command over-rides the default tick generation with a set of ticks ar
regular intervals.  The syntax is reminiscent of programming
language for loops.  Ticks are placed starting at
<replaceable>start_expr</replaceable>
ending at
<replaceable>end_expr</replaceable>
one unit apart.  If the
<command>by</command>
clause is specified, ticks are
<replaceable>by_expr</replaceable>
units apart.  If an operator appears before
<replaceable>by_expr</replaceable>
each tick is operated on by that operator instead of +.  For example</para>
<programlisting remap='Bd'>
ticks left out from 2 to 32 by *2
</programlisting> <!-- remap='Ed (block)' -->

<para>will put ticks at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.  If
<replaceable>format_string</replaceable>
is specified, all ticks are formatted using it.</para>

<para>The parameters preceding the
<command>from</command>
act as described above.</para>

<para>The 
<command>at</command>
and 
<command>for</command>
forms of tick command may both be issued on the same
side of a frame.  For example:</para>
<programlisting remap='Bd'>
ticks left out from 2 to 32 by *2
ticks left in 3, 5, 7
</programlisting> <!-- remap='Ed (block)' -->

<para>will put ticks on the left side of the frame pointing out at 2, 4, 8,
16, and 32 and in at 3, 5, and 7.</para>

<para>The final form of 
<command remap='Ic'>ticks</command>
turns off ticks on a given side.  If no side is given the ticks for

[format_string]
The
<command remap='Ic'>grid</command>
command is similar to the 
<command remap='Ic'>ticks</command>
command except that 
<command remap='Ic'>grid</command>
specifies the placement of lines in the frame.  The syntax is similar
to 
<command remap='Ic'>ticks</command>
as well.</para>  

<para>By specifying 
<literal>ticks</literal> <literal>off</literal>
in the command, no ticks are drawn on that side of the frame.  If
ticks appear on a side by default, or have been declared by an earlier
<command remap='Ic'>ticks</command>
command, 
<command remap='Ic'>grid</command>
does not cancel them unless 
<literal>ticks</literal> <literal>off</literal>
is specified.</para>

<para>Instead of a direction for ticks, 
<command remap='Ic'>grid</command>
allows the user to pick a line description for the grid lines.  The
usual
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
line descriptions are allowed.</para>

<para>Grids are labelled by default.  To omit labels, specify the format
string as 
"".</para>

<para>If 
<command remap='Ic'>sprintf</command>
is disabled, 
<command remap='Ic'>grid</command>
behaves as
<command remap='Ic'>plot</command>
with respect to the format string.</para>

The 
<command remap='Ic'>label</command>
command places a label on the given axis.  It is possible to specify
several labels, which will be stacked over each other as in 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>.
The final argument, if present, specifies how many inches the label is
shifted from the axis.</para>

<para>By default the labels on the left and right labels run parallel to the
frame.  You can cancel this by specifying 
<literal>unaligned</literal>
as a 
<replaceable>string_modifier</replaceable>.</para>

<command>at</command>
<replaceable>coordinate_name</replaceable>
<replaceable>expr</replaceable>, <replaceable>expr</replaceable>
<command>radius</command> <replaceable>expr</replaceable>
<replaceable>linedesc</replaceable>
This draws an circle at the point indicated.  By default, the
circle is small, 0.025 inches.  This can be over-ridden by specifying
a radius.  The coordinates of the point are relative to the named
coordinate system, or the default system if none is specified.</para>

<para>This command has been extended to take a line description,
e.g., 
<literal>dotted</literal>.
It also accepts the filling extensions described below in the
<command remap='Ic'>bar</command>
command.  It will also accept a 
<command remap='Ic'>color</command>
keyword that gives the color of the outline of the circle in double
quotes and a
<command remap='Ic'>fillcolor</command>
command that sets the color to fill the circle with similarly.  Colors
are only available when compatibility mode is off, and using a version
of GNU pic that supports color.</para>

The 
<replaceable>line_description</replaceable>
can be given either before the
<command>from</command>

clause.  If both are given the second is used.  It is possible to
specify one point in one coordinate system and one in another, note
that if both points are in a named coordinate system (even if they are
in the same named coordinate system), both points must have

given.</para>


<para><command remap='Ic'>copy</command>
"Ar filename"
<command>until</command> "Ar string"
<command>thru</command> <replaceable>macro</replaceable>
The
<command remap='Ic'>copy</command>
command imports data from another file into the current graph.  The
form with only a filename given is a simple file inclusion; the
included file is simply read into the input stream and can contain
arbitrary
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
commands.  The more common case is that it is a number list; see
<link role='Sx' linkend='number_lists'>Number Lists</link>
below.</para>

<para>The second form takes lines from the file, splits them into words
delimited by one or more spaces, and calls the given macro with those
words as parameters.  The macro may either be defined here, or be a
macro defined earlier.  See
<link  linkend='macros'>Macros</link>
for more information on macros.</para>

<para>The
<replaceable>filename</replaceable>
may be omitted if the 
<command>until</command>
clause is present.  If so the current file is treated as the input
file until
<replaceable>string</replaceable>
is encountered at the beginning of the line.</para>

<para><command remap='Ic'>copy</command>
is one of the workhorses of 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>

Unlike K&amp;B 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
no macro or variable expansion is done.  I believe that this is also
true for GNU 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
version 1.10.  See the 
<link  linkend='macros'>Macros</link>
section for information on defining blocks.</para>

<para><command remap='Ic'>graph</command> <replaceable>Name</replaceable> <replaceable>pic_commands</replaceable>
This command is used to position graphs with respect to each other.
The current graph is given the

name
<replaceable>Name</replaceable>
(names used by 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>
begin with capital letters).  Any 
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pic</refentrytitle></citerefentry>

The 
<command remap='Ic'>bar</command>
command facilitates drawing bar graphs.  The first form of the
command describes the bar somewhat generally and has 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
place it.
The bar may extend up or to the right, is centered on 
<replaceable>offset</replaceable>
and extends up or right 
<replaceable>height</replaceable>
units (in the given coordinate system).  For example</para>
<programlisting remap='Bd'>
bar up 3 ht 2
</programlisting> <!-- remap='Ed (block)' -->

<para>draws a 2 unit high bar sitting on the x axis, centered on x=3.  By
default bars are 1 unit wide, but this can be changed with the 
<command remap='Ic'>wid</command>
keyword.  By default bars sit on the base axis, i.e., bars directed up
will extend from y=0.  That may be overridden by the 
<command remap='Ic'>base</command>
keyword.  (The bar described above has corners (2.5, 0) and (3.5, 2).)</para>

<para>The line description has been extended to include a 
<command remap='Ic'>fill</command> <replaceable>expr</replaceable>
keyword that specifies the shading inside the bar.  Bars may be drawn
in any line style.  They support the
<command remap='Ic'>color</command>
and 
<command remap='Ic'>fillcolor</command>
keywords described under
<command remap='Ic'>circle</command>.</para>

<para>The second form of the command draws a box with the two points as
corners.  This can be used to draw boxes highlighting certain data as
well as bar graphs.  Note that filled bars will cover data drawn under
them.</para>

<para><command remap='Ic'>if</command> <replaceable>expr</replaceable> <command remap='Ic'>then</command> <replaceable>block</replaceable>
<command remap='Ic'>else</command> <replaceable>block</replaceable>
The
<command remap='Ic'>if</command>
statement provides simple conditional execution.  If
<replaceable>expr</replaceable>
is non-zero, the 
<replaceable>block</replaceable>
after the 
<command remap='Ic'>then</command>
statement is executed.  If not the 
<replaceable>block</replaceable>
after the
<command remap='Ic'>else</command>
is executed, if present.  See
<link  linkend='macros'>Macros</link>
for the definition of blocks.  Early versions of this implementation
of
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
treated the blocks as macros that were defined and expanded in place.
This led to unnecessary confusion because explicit separators were
sometimes called for.  Now,
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
inserts a separator (;) after the last character in 
<replaceable>block</replaceable>,
so constructs like</para> 
<programlisting remap='Bd'>
if (x == 3) { y = y + 1 }
x = x + 1

</programlisting> <!-- remap='Ed (block)' -->
<para>behave as expected.  A separator is also appended to the end of a

block.</para>

<command remap='Ic'>do</command>
<replaceable>block</replaceable>
This command executes

iteratively.  The variable
<replaceable>name</replaceable>
is set to 
<replaceable>from_expr</replaceable>
and incremented by
<replaceable>by_expr</replaceable>
until it exceeds

The iteration has the semantics defined in the

</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='expressions'><title>Expressions</title>

<para><command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
supports most standard arithmetic operators: + - / * ^.  The carat
(^) is exponentiation.  In an 
<command remap='Ic'>if</command>
statement
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
also supports the C logical operators ==, !=,
&amp;&amp;, || and unary !.  Also in an
<command remap='Ic'>if</command>,
== and != are overloaded for the comparison of
quoted strings.  Parentheses are used for grouping.</para>  

<para>Assignment is not allowed in an expression in any context, except for
simple cascading of assignments.
<literal>a</literal> <literal>=</literal> <literal>b</literal> <literal>=</literal> <literal>35</literal>
works as expected;
<literal>a</literal> <literal>=</literal> <literal>3.5</literal> <literal>*</literal> <literal>(b</literal> <literal>=</literal> <literal>10)</literal>
does not execute.</para>

<para><command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
supports the following functions that take one argument:
<command remap='Ic'>log</command>, <command remap='Ic'>exp</command>, <command remap='Ic'>int</command>, <command remap='Ic'>sin</command>, <command remap='Ic'>cos</command>, <command remap='Ic'>sqrt</command>, <command remap='Ic'>rand</command>.
The logarithms are base 10 and the trigonometric functions are in
radians.  
<command remap='Ic'>eexp</command>
returns Euler's number to the given power and
<command remap='Ic'>ln</command>
returns the natural logarithm.  The natural log and exponentiation
functions are extensions and are probably not available in other
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
implementations.</para>

<para><command remap='Ic'>rand</command>
returns a random number uniformly
distributed on [0,1).  The following two-argument functions are supported:
<command remap='Ic'>atan2</command>, <command remap='Ic'>min</command>, <command remap='Ic'>max</command>.
<command remap='Ic'>atan2</command>
works just like
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>atan2</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
The random number generator can be seeded by calling 
<command remap='Ic'>srand</command>
with a single parameter (converted internally to an integer).  Because
its return value is of no use, you must use 
<command remap='Ic'>srand</command>
as a separate statement, it is not part of a valid expression.
<command remap='Ic'>srand</command>
is not portable.</para>

<para>The
<command remap='Ic'>getpid</command>
function takes no arguments and returns the process id.  This may be
used to seed the random number generator, but do not expect
cryptographically random values to result.</para>

<para>Other than string comparison, no expressions can use strings.  One
string valued function exists: 
<command remap='Ic'>sprintf</command> (, <replaceable>format</replaceable>
[<replaceable>expr</replaceable> <replaceable>,</replaceable> <replaceable>expr</replaceable>]
).  It operates like
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>sprintf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
except returning the value.  It can be used anywhere a quoted string
is used.  If 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
is run with 
<option>-S</option>,
the environment variable
<envar>GRAP_SAFER</envar>
is defined, or 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
has been compiled for safer operation, the 
<command remap='Ic'>sprintf</command>
command will return the format string.  This mode of operation is only
intended to be used only if
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
is being used as part of a super-user enabled print system.</para>
</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='macros'><title>Macros</title>
<para><command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
has a simple but powerful macro facility.  Macros are defined using
the 
<command remap='Ic'>define</command>
command :</para>

<para><command remap='Ic'>define</command> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>block</replaceable>
<!-- br -->
<command remap='Ic'>undefine</command> <replaceable>name</replaceable>
Every occurrence of 
<replaceable>name</replaceable>
in the program text is replaced by the contents of 
<replaceable>block</replaceable>.
<replaceable>block</replaceable>
is defined by a series of statements in nested { }'s, or a series of
statements surrounded by the same letter.  An example of the latter is</para>
<programlisting remap='Bd'>
define foo  X coord x 1,3 X
</programlisting> <!-- remap='Ed (block)' -->
<para>Each time 
<literal>foo</literal>
appears in the text, it will be replaced by 
<literal>coord</literal> <literal>x</literal> <literal>1,3</literal>.
Macros are literal, and can contain newlines.  If a macro does not
span multiple lines, it should end in a semicolon to avoid parsing
errors.</para>

<para>Macros can take parameters, too.  If a macro call is followed by a
parenthesized, comma-separated list the values starting with $1 will
be replaced in the macro with the elements of the list.  A $ not
followed by a digit is left unchanged.  This parsing
is very rudimentary; no nesting or parentheses or escaping of commas
is allowed.  Also, there is no way to say argument 1 followed by a
digit (${1}0 in sh(1)).</para>

<para>The following will draw a line with slope 1.</para>
<programlisting remap='Bd'>
<synopsis>
define foo { next at $1, $2 }
for i from 1 to 5 { foo(i,i) }
</synopsis>
</programlisting> <!-- remap='Ed (block)' -->
<para>Macros persist across graphs.  The file 
<filename>/usr/local/share/grap/grap.defines</filename>
contains simple macros for plotting common characters.  The 
<command remap='Ic'>undefine</command>
command deletes a macro.</para>

<refsect2 id='number_lists'><title>Number Lists</title>

<para>A whitespace-separated list of numbers is treated specially.  The list
is taken to be points to be plotted using the default line style on
the default coordinate system.  If more than two numbers are given,
the extra numbers are taken to be additional y values to plot at the
first x value.  Number lists in DWB 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
can be comma-separated, and this 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
supports that as well.  More precisely, numbers in number lists can be
separated by either whitespace, commas, or both.</para>
<programlisting remap='Bd'>

</programlisting> <!-- remap='Ed (block)' -->

<refsect2 id='pic_macros'><title>Pic Macros</title>

<para><command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
defines pic macros that can be used in embedded pic code to place
elements in the graph.  The macros are
<command remap='Ic'>x_gg</command>,
<command remap='Ic'>y_gg</command>,
and
<command remap='Ic'>xy_gg</command>.
These macros define pic distances that correspond to the given
argument.  They can be used to size boxes or to plot pic constructs on
the graph.  To place a given construct on the graph, you should add
Frame.Origin to it.
Other coordinate spaces can be used by replacing 
<command remap='Ic'>gg</command>
with the name of the coordinate space.  A coordinate space named
<command remap='Ic'>gg</command>
cannot be reliably accessed by these macros.</para>

<para>The macros are emitted immediately before the frame is drawn.</para>

<para>DWB
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
may use these as part of its implementation.  This
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
provides them only for compatibility.  Note that these are very simple
macros, and may not do what you expect under complex conditions.</para>

<refsect1 id='bugs'><title>BUGS</title>

<para>There are several small incompatibilities with K&amp;R
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
They include the
<command remap='Ic'>sh</command>
command not expanding variables and macros, and a more strict
adherence to parameter order in the internal commands.</para>

<para>Although much improved, the error reporting code can still be
confused.  Notably, an error in a macro is not detected until the
macro is used, and it produces unusual output in the error message.</para>

<para>Iterating many times over a macro with no newlines can run 
<command remap='Nm'> grap </command>
out of memory.</para>
