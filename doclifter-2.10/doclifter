doclifter: translate man/mdoc/ms/me/mm sources to DocBook.

By Eric S. Raymond, copyright 2002, 2006, 2007.
Released as open source under the BSD license.

This comment is addressed to you if you want to add support for another
macro package to doclifter.  Or if you have encountered a bug in doclifter 
and need to understand the code in doclifter in order to fix it.  Or if
you just want to understand how it works.

This code has only one piece of global state: globalhints.  Two other
globals, stdout and stderr, don't retain state.  A global
prettyprinter instance named `pretty' may be created if you're debugging.

Internally, doclifter consists mainly of a framework class called
DocLifter.  This class is instantiated and told to do its stuff
by a routine called transfile, which handles all I/O to disk and gives
doclifter its cc-like invocation protocol.  Underneath, it passes
TroffInterpreter a string consisting of the entire text of the file to
be translated and accepts a translated string back.

TroffInterpreter provides I/O and other basic services for a stack of request
interpreters.  Interpreters get added to the stack when TroffInterpreter 
recognizes certain patterns in the input; see the table interpreter_dispatch
for details.  If a string pattern added to this table is length 2, 
TroffInterpreter will assume it is a request name and check to make sure
that it's not a macro.

The interpreter stack always includes TroffInterpreter at the bottom.  This
request interpreter handles the small set of troff requests that we translate,
including .so, .nf, .fi, .if, etc.  It also handles macro and string expansion.

Note that commands are looked up in reverse order of class activation, e.g
most rescent extension set first.  This means that definitions in a later
class override definitions in earlier ones.

Each request interpreter is a class that provides methods and members to be
used by the framework.  Here they are:

name
   The name of the macro set

exclusive
   Whether this is a "major" macro set like man, mdoc, mm, ms, or me --
as opposed to a minor one like pod2man or TkMan.  Whichever major macro
set is triggered earliest in the file gets a lock on it; trigger patterns
from other exclusive macros are subsequently ignored.

toptag
   The top-level tag in the type of DocBook that this request interpreter
generates.  The top tag for the generated XML will be the top tag of the only
exclusive macro set in the stack, if there is one; otherwise it will be the
top tag of the most recently added interpreter.

ignore_set
   Tags to ignore.  List here any presentation-level tags that don't have
structural implications.  They will be silently discarded.
   Note: there is a potential subtle gotcha in the handling of ignore
sets.  The code presently assumes that no tag in any interpreter's
ignore set is handled by any other interpreter.

complain_set
   Tags to complain about.  Put here things that can't be translated out
of presentation level but that might have structural meaning (such as
indentation changes).  The user will be warned on stderr when these 
come up.  Otherwise they're ignored.

parabreak_set
   The set of tags that forces a new paragraph without changing the
document section.  Used to recognize the end of lists.

sectionbreak_set
   The set of tags that forces a new document section.  Things that
are going to translate to a DocBook sect, refsect, or section tag 
should go here.  

listbreak_set
   The set of tags that forces an end to a list section.  Normally
includes everything in the sectionbreak_set.

translations
   Special-character to ISO literal mappings.  These are applied late
in the translation, *after* string and macro evaluation.
   It's also useful to know that your request interpreter can call the
function declare_body_start() to tell the framework class where the
body of the document starts (as opposed to the preamble full of troff
requests).  This infornation is used to restrict the scope of
character translations.

interpret
   The request interpreter.  Called on every input line that begins 
with a command character, that is . or ' not followed by another ' on the
same line.
   This method needs to be careful about troff continuation (\c)
characters.  If you add trailing markup to a line, or entirely replace the 
line, be sure to check for trailing \c first, remove it if present, and
paste it back on the end.

preprocess, postprocess
   Pre-processing and postprocessing hooks.  Each takes a string
(assumed to be the entire file text) and returns a string.

reductions:
   A list of pairs of macro names.  In each pair, the first is to be
replaced by the second if this macro set is active and the definition of
the first contains the second.  This member is useful for replacing
stereotyped wrapper macros with standard constructs that the translator
knows how to handle.  
   Most frequent case: lots of man page authors define a .Pp macro that
does various funky things in troff but just expands to .PP in nroff.
If we replace this with .PP various nasty parsing situations suddenly
don't break.

The easiest way to write a full-blown new request interpreter is to
take an existing one and mutate it.  If the macro package you are
trying to support merely adds a few tags to an existing one, consider
writing an interpreter for just those tags and adding it to the stack
(this is the way the Pod2ManInterpreter code relates to
ManInterpreter).  

Warning: much of this code is grubby.  Alas, the grubbiness is
intrinsic, because the troff request language is grubby.

        # Synopsis sections in man pages come in three different flavors
        # that need to be marked up differently -- command synopses,
        # function synopses, and plain old text.
        #
        # Trying to analyze Synopsis sections raises three problems.
        # The first and worst problem is that there are no airtight syntactic
        # ways to distinguish between the three different section types.
        #
        # The second problem is that there is stuff we shouldn't even bother
        # trying to parse because it's hopeless -- Perl synopses are the
        # largest subcategory of these.  We should detect these and pass
        # them through as plain-text Synopsis sections.
        #
        # Unfortunately, we can't resolve the problem before doing
        # first-pass macrointerpretation of the whole synopsis
        # section.  That's how we get mdoc macros evaluated -- and
        # there may be others the man-page author created.  This
        # means the text we're interpreting may contain <. >, and tags.
        #

        # command synopses, or lines that we can unambiguously identify as
        # natural language.  When we fail to find one starting on a
        # given line, we stash that line away and advance to the next.
