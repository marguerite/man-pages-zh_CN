.SH NAME
wctrans \- wide-character translation mapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "wctrans_t wctrans(const char *" name );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I wctrans_t
type represents a mapping
which can map a wide character to
another wide character.
Its nature is implementation-dependent, but the special
value
.IR "(wctrans_t)\ 0"
denotes an invalid mapping.
Nonzero
.I wctrans_t
values can be passed to the
.BR towctrans (3)
function to actually perform
the wide-character mapping.
.PP
The
.BR wctrans ()
function returns a mapping, given by its name.
The set of
valid names depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale, but the
following names are valid in all locales.
.nf
  "tolower" \- realizes the \fBtolower\fP(3) mapping
  "toupper" \- realizes the \fBtoupper\fP(3) mapping
.fi
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR wctrans ()
function returns a mapping descriptor if the
.I name
is valid.
Otherwise, it returns
.IR "(wctrans_t)\ 0" .
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR wctrans ()
function is thread-safe with exceptions.
It can be safely used in multithreaded applications, as long as
.BR setlocale (3)
is not called to change the locale during its execution.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99.
.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.BR wctrans ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
