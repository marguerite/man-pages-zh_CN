.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions
.BR qecvt (),
.BR qfcvt ()
and
.BR qgcvt ()
are identical to
.BR ecvt (3),
.BR fcvt (3)
and
.BR gcvt (3)
respectively, except that they use a
.I "long double"
argument
.IR number .
See
.BR ecvt (3)
and
.BR gcvt (3).
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR qecvt ()
and
.BR qfcvt ()
functions are not thread-safe.
.LP
The
.BR qgcvt ()
function is thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4.
Not seen in most common UNIX implementations,
but occurs in SunOS.
Not supported by libc4 and libc5.
Supported by glibc.
.SH NOTES
These functions are obsolete.
Instead,
.BR snprintf (3)
is recommended.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR ecvt (3),
.BR ecvt_r (3),
.BR gcvt (3),
.BR sprintf (3)
