.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "int wcwidth(wchar_t " c );

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR wcwidth ()
function returns the number of columns
needed to represent the wide character
.IR c .
If
.I c
is a printable wide character, the value
is at least 0.
If
.I c
is null wide character (L\(aq\\0\(aq), the value is 0.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR wcwidth ()
function returns the number of
column positions for
.IR c .
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR wcwidth ()
function is thread-safe with exceptions.
It can be safely used in multithreaded applications, as long as
.BR setlocale (3)
is not called to change the locale during its execution.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.

Note that glibc before 2.2.5 used the prototype
.br
.nf
.BI "int wcwidth(wint_t " c );
.fi
.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.BR wcwidth ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
