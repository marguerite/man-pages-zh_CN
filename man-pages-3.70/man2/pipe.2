.TH PIPE 2 2014-07-08 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
pipe, pipe2 \- create pipe
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int pipe(int " pipefd "[2]);"
.sp
.BR "#define _GNU_SOURCE" "             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */"
.BR "#include <fcntl.h>" "              /* Obtain O_* constant definitions */
.B #include <unistd.h>

.BI "int pipe2(int " pipefd "[2], int " flags );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR pipe ()
creates a pipe, a unidirectional data channel that
can be used for interprocess communication.
The array
.IR pipefd
is used to return two file descriptors referring to the ends of the pipe.
.IR pipefd[0]
refers to the read end of the pipe.
.IR pipefd[1]
refers to the write end of the pipe.
Data written to the write end of the pipe is buffered by the kernel
until it is read from the read end of the pipe.
For further details, see
.BR pipe (7).

If
.IR flags
is 0, then
.BR pipe2 ()
is the same as
.BR pipe ().
The following values can be bitwise ORed in
.IR flags
to obtain different behavior:
.TP
.B O_CLOEXEC
Set the close-on-exec
.RB ( FD_CLOEXEC )
flag on the two new file descriptors.
See the description of the same flag in
.BR open (2)
for reasons why this may be useful.
.TP
.BR O_DIRECT " (since Linux 3.4)"
.\" commit 9883035ae7edef3ec62ad215611cb8e17d6a1a5d
Create a pipe that performs I/O in "packet" mode.
Each
.BR write (2)
to the pipe is dealt with as a separate packet, and
.BR read (2)s
from the pipe will read one packet at a time.
Note the following points:
.RS
.IP * 3
Writes of greater than
.BR PIPE_BUF
bytes (see
.BR pipe (7))
will be split into multiple packets.
The constant
.BR PIPE_BUF
is defined in
.IR <limits.h> .
.IP *
If a
.BR read (2)
specifies a buffer size that is smaller than the next packet,
then the requested number of bytes are read,
and the excess bytes in the packet are discarded.
Specifying a buffer size of
.BR PIPE_BUF
will be sufficient to read the largest possible packets
(see the previous point).
.IP *
Zero-length packets are not supported.
(A
.BR read (2)
that specifies a buffer size of zero is a no-op, and returns 0.)
.RE
.IP
Older kernels that do not support this flag will indicate this via an
.B EINVAL
error.
.TP
.B O_NONBLOCK
Set the
.BR O_NONBLOCK
file status flag on the two new open file descriptions.
Using this flag saves extra calls to
.BR fcntl (2)
to achieve the same result.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I pipefd
is not valid.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.RB ( pipe2 ())
Invalid value in
.IR flags .
.TP
.B EMFILE
Too many file descriptors are in use by the process.
.TP
.B ENFILE
The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
.SH VERSIONS
.BR pipe2 ()
was added to Linux in version 2.6.27;
glibc support is available starting with
version 2.9.
.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR pipe ():
POSIX.1-2001.

.BR pipe2 ()
is Linux-specific.
.SH EXAMPLE
.\" fork.2 refers to this example program.
The following program creates a pipe, and then
.BR fork (2)s
to create a child process;
the child inherits a duplicate set of file
descriptors that refer to the same pipe.
After the
.BR fork (2),
each process closes the descriptors that it doesn't need for the pipe
(see
.BR pipe (7)).
The parent then writes the string contained in the program's
command-line argument to the pipe,
and the child reads this string a byte at a time from the pipe
and echoes it on standard output.
