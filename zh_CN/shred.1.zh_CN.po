"remove a directory entry: 'unlink' =&gt; use a standard unlink call. 'wipe' "

"CAUTION: Note that shred relies on a very important assumption: that the "

"In the case of ext3 file systems, the above disclaimer applies (and shred is "

"file data in addition to just metadata. In both the data=ordered (default) "
"and data=writeback modes, shred works as usual. Ext3 journaling modes can be "
