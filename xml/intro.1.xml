<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<para>Section 1 of the manual describes user commands and tools,
for example, file manipulation tools, shells, compilers,
web browsers, file and image viewers and editors, and so on.</para>

<para>All commands yield a status value on termination.
This value can be tested (e.g., in most shells the variable
<emphasis remap='I'>$?</emphasis>
contains the status of the last executed command)
to see whether the command completed successfully.
A zero exit status is conventionally used to indicate success,
and a nonzero status means that the command was unsuccessful.
(Details of the exit status can be found in
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>wait</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>.)
A nonzero exit status can be in the range 1 to 255, and some commands
use different nonzero status values to indicate the reason why the
command failed.</para>

<refsect1 id='notes'><title>NOTES</title>
<para>Linux is a flavor of UNIX, and as a first approximation
all user commands under UNIX work precisely the same under
Linux (and FreeBSD and lots of other UNIX-like systems).</para>

<para>Under Linux, there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you
can point and click and drag, and hopefully get work done without
first reading lots of documentation.
The traditional UNIX environment
is a CLI (command line interface), where you type commands to
tell the computer what to do.
That is faster and more powerful,
but requires finding out what the commands are.
Below a bare minimum, to get started.</para>

<refsect2 id='login'><title>Login</title>
<para>In order to start working, you probably first have to login,
that is, give your username and password.
See also
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>login</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
The program
<emphasis remap='I'>login</emphasis>
now starts a
<emphasis remap='I'>shell</emphasis>
(command interpreter) for you.
In case of a graphical login, you get a screen with menus or icons
and a mouse click will start a shell in a window.

</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='the_shell'><title>The shell</title>
<para>One types commands to the
<emphasis remap='I'>shell</emphasis>,
the command interpreter.
It is not built-in, but is just a program
and you can change your shell.
Everybody has her own favorite one.
The standard one is called
<emphasis remap='I'>sh</emphasis>.

<para>and here typing Control-D ended the session.
The
<emphasis remap='B'>% </emphasis>
here was the command prompt&mdash;it is the shell's way of indicating
that it is ready for the next command.
The prompt can be customized
in lots of ways, and one might include stuff like username,
machine name, current directory, time, and so on.
An assignment PS1="What next, master? "
would change the prompt as indicated.</para>

<para>We see that there are commands
<emphasis remap='I'>date</emphasis>
(that gives date and time), and
<emphasis remap='I'>cal</emphasis>
(that gives a calendar).</para>

<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>ls</emphasis>
lists the contents of the current directory&mdash;it tells you what
files you have.
With a
<option>-l</option>
option it gives a long listing,
that includes the owner and size and date of the file, and the
permissions people have for reading and/or changing the file.
For example, the file "tel" here is 37 bytes long, owned by aeb
and the owner can read and write it, others can only read it.
Owner and permissions can be changed by the commands
<emphasis remap='I'>chown</emphasis>
and
<emphasis remap='I'>chmod</emphasis>.</para>

<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>cat</emphasis>
will show the contents of a file.
(The name is from "concatenate and print": all files given as
parameters are concatenated and sent to "standard output", here
the terminal screen.)</para>

<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>cp</emphasis>
(from "copy") will copy a file.
On the other hand, the command
<emphasis remap='I'>mv</emphasis>
(from "move") only renames it.</para>

<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>diff</emphasis>
lists the differences between two files.
Here there was no output because there were no differences.</para>

<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>rm</emphasis>
(from "remove") deletes the file, and be careful! it is gone.
No wastepaper basket or anything.
Deleted means lost.</para>

<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>grep</emphasis>
(from "g/re/p") finds occurrences of a string in one or more files.
Here it finds Maja's telephone number.</para>
</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='pathnames_and_the_current_directory'><title>Pathnames and the current directory</title>
<para>Files live in a large tree, the file hierarchy.
Each has a
<emphasis remap='I'>pathname</emphasis>
describing the path from the root of the tree (which is called /)
to the file.
For example, such a full pathname might be /home/aeb/tel.
Always using full pathnames would be inconvenient, and the name
of a file in the current directory may be abbreviated by giving
only the last component.
That is why "/home/aeb/tel" can be abbreviated
to "tel" when the current directory is "/home/aeb".</para>

<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>pwd</emphasis>
prints the current directory.</para>

<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>cd</emphasis>
changes the current directory.
Try "cd /" and "pwd" and "cd" and "pwd".</para>
</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='directories'><title>Directories</title>
<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>mkdir</emphasis>
makes a new directory.</para>

<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>rmdir</emphasis>
removes a directory if it is empty, and complains otherwise.</para>

<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>find</emphasis>
(with a rather baroque syntax) will find files with given name
or other properties.
For example, "find . -name tel" would find
the file "tel" starting in the present directory (which is called ".").
And "find / -name tel" would do the same, but starting at the root
of the tree.
Large searches on a multi-GB disk will be time-consuming,
and it may be better to use
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>locate</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>
</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='disks_and_filesystems'><title>Disks and filesystems</title>
<para>The command
<emphasis remap='I'>mount</emphasis>
will attach the filesystem found on some disk (or floppy, or CDROM or so)
to the big filesystem hierarchy.
And
<emphasis remap='I'>umount</emphasis>
detaches it again.
The command
<emphasis remap='I'>df</emphasis>
will tell you how much of your disk is still free.</para>
</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='processes'><title>Processes</title>
<para>On a UNIX system many user and system processes run simultaneously.
The one you are talking to runs in the
<emphasis remap='I'>foreground</emphasis>,
the others in the
<emphasis remap='I'>background</emphasis>.
The command
<emphasis remap='I'>ps</emphasis>
will show you which processes are active and what numbers these
processes have.
The command
<emphasis remap='I'>kill</emphasis>
allows you to get rid of them.
Without option this is a friendly
request: please go away.
And "kill -9" followed by the number
of the process is an immediate kill.
Foreground processes can often be killed by typing Control-C.</para>
</refsect2>

<refsect2 id='getting_information'><title>Getting information</title>
<para>There are thousands of commands, each with many options.
Traditionally commands are documented on
<emphasis remap='I'>man pages</emphasis>,
(like this one), so that the command "man kill" will document
the use of the command "kill" (and "man man" document the command "man").
The program
<emphasis remap='I'>man</emphasis>
sends the text through some
<emphasis remap='I'>pager</emphasis>,
usually
<emphasis remap='I'>less</emphasis>.
Hit the space bar to get the next page, hit q to quit.</para>

<para>In documentation it is customary to refer to man pages
by giving the name and section number, as in
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>man</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
Man pages are terse, and allow you to find quickly some forgotten
detail.
For newcomers an introductory text with more examples
and explanations is useful.</para>

<para>A lot of GNU/FSF software is provided with info files.
Type "info info"
for an introduction on the use of the program "info".</para>

<para>Special topics are often treated in HOWTOs.
Look in
<filename>/usr/share/doc/howto/en</filename>
and use a browser if you find HTML files there.</para>
