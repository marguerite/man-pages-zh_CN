## Modern manpage localization project for Chinese language

It's based on manpages-zh project, a successor for CMPP linux man
pages translation project (discontinued), and Linux CN linux man
pages translation project, with some new addons from openSUSE
maintainers.

It's been used by openSUSE project as source for man-pages-zh_CN package.

### History

CMPP project once maintained manpage-zh project, but it's dead.

Now Linux-cn maintain another manpage-zh project, but no useful result has been seen.

So I decided to maintain my own.

If the above two projects have any updates, I'll merge them here.

If not, I will do my own translations here.

### Layouts

* man-pages-xxx Latest upstream sources
* manpages-zh the old translated manpages from CMPP project
* 50-pot pot directory
* docfilter a tool directory, don't touch it
* raw raw directory for manpages to translate
* xml middle file (xml) directory
* zh_CN po file directory
* finished_po translated po files go there
* xml_cn translated xml files converted from po
* mxml middle file converted from translated xml
* output uncompressed manpages (ideal for put into package sources)
* compressed compressed manpages (ideal for use directly)

### How to convert Linux manpages to human readable format (.po) ?

You need `xml2po` program installed, for openSUSE:

 sudo zypper in xml2po

* Copy the manpage you want to translate to the `raw` directory.
* Run the `unpack.sh` script, it will unpack the .gz manpages.
* Run the `man2xml.sh` script, it will generate xml files in xml directory.
* Run the `xml2pot.sh` script, it will generate pot files in 50-pot directory.
* Run the `merge.sh` script, it will merge the pot into the po files.

Then translate as you want.

### How to convert .po files into manages?

You need `xml2po` and `docbook2x` packages installed, for openSUSE:

 sudo zypper in xml2po docbook2x

* Copy the finished po to `finished_po` directory
* Run `po2xml.sh` script, it'll generate translated xml in `xml_cn` directory
* Run `xml2man.sh` script, it'll generate uncompressed manpage in `output` directory and compressed ones in `compressed` directory
