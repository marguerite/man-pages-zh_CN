  Many more instances of .ta are now automatically handled.
  Multi-file compilation was broken, is now repaired.

2.11 @ 2013-06-01

  Bell Labs or Berkeley meaning of .P1 is dispatched to depending on 
  whether .P2 is present.  Added -w option for strict portability checking.
  Fedora bug 220736 fixed. All troff glyphs are now mapped (added
  bracket-pile characters, yogh, hooked-o, and underdot).  You are now
  warned of sequences that look like glyphs but can't be mapped.
  Table handling for mdoc pages has been much improved.  Tests for
  requests that can't be turned into structure are stricter.
  Appropriate cases of \o are now translated into Latin-1 and Latin-2
  letters with accents.  Inline ad-hoc tables made with .ta and
  literal tabs are now lifted. Groff extended escapes $* and $@ are
  now handled.  Speed optimizations so it's about 30% faster, and a
  profiling switch on manlifter. Rudimentary DocBook V5 translation, but
  inclusions and character entities are iffy and untested.

  only in batch mode.  Use current list indent on block start/end.

2.1 @ 2005-01-14
  Interrupt handlers are refactored so manlifter can be aborted with
  a single ^C; as a result, exit values 4 and 5 have swapped places.
  In manlifter, don't remove the result file unless we're in batchmode.
  Lifts 96% of 11121 pages in a full Fedora Core 3 install.

2.0 @ 2004-12-24
  Added manlifter to the distribution. doclifter no longer strips off file 
  extensions before appending .xml. Major improvement in parsing of
  displays; C function prototypes are now recognized in them.

1.15 @ 2004-11-20
  Fix logic for flushing mdoc namediv.  Handle tables within mdoc
  lists better.  Strip out some pod2man-generated cliches.

  required file extensions for mm, me, ms.  Now lift some trivial uses
  of eqn(1) markup.  Better handling of mm header markup.  Interpret

  Speed optimizations.  Improved pod2man detection.  Close <anchor/> properly.
  .UN before .SH or .SS sets the XML ID of the generated section.
  Boldfaced lines immediately before tables are interpreted as titles. .UR now
  generates <link> for local links.  Improved .RE handling that fixes
  a couple of edge cases.  Multiline table entries are now interpreted as full
  blocks, so commands work normally there.

1.10 @ 2004-07-06
  Enhance to handle lynx dump pages.  Fix .Fa interpretation.  
  Gets 96% of 10862 Fedora Core 2 pages.

  John Franklin's support for the Vt macro in mdoc.  Tuning for Psyco.

1.8 @ 2004-03-01

  of nested .if/.ie requests. Process Fa macro correctly.

  in text with `` and ''.  Catch a few more .RS/.RE cases.

1.3 @ 2003-12-15
  Process .RS/.RE tags to generate list nesting.  As a side effect,
  this change fixes bad interactions between .ig and .TP. Fix a bug in 
  gathering hints from function prologs.  Use <varname>
  rather than <symbol> for variables.  Work around a common bug in ISC
  man pages. Evaluate one-line .el macros properly.

1.2 @ 2003-12-08
  SGML-generation support removed; the -s and -x options now
  control whether troff special characters are translated to the
  ISO entity set or the XHTML entity set.
  Corrected a bug in processing of synopses with multiple commands.
  Handle \f[012434] font changes in synopses correctly. -D option
  supports posting hints at startup time.  Better recognition of 
  filenames and commands in running text.  Error return values
  now convey more information.

1.1 @ 2003-12-04
  Fixed a bug in conditional evaluation that twadmin(8) tickled.
  Better detection of pure inclusions. Better blank-section 
  elimination.  Kleene star recognized as ... synonym in command
  synopses.  Correct some bugs in semantic-hint collection.
  Limited internationalization -- recognize "NAME" in a couple
  of different languages.  Recognize Qt manual pages and use their
  conventions.  Better lifting of mandoc-generated pages. Translate
  groff-style \[...] escapes, flag unknown ones.  Can now parse
  K&R style function prototypes as well as ANSI ones. This version 
  lifts 96% of 9829 manual pages in a full Red Hat 9 installation
  with Fedora updates to *validated* XML-DocBook.

1.0.6 @ 2003-11-20
  Lots of changes made so the XML output will pass validation.
  Appropriately wrap <citerefentry> sequences generated from SEE ALSO.
  Clean up generated <sbrk/> tags when we don't find a function or
  command synopsis.  Push back folded highlights so paragraph generation
  doesn't get screwed up.  Don't generate invalid class attribute for
  <programlisting> and <symbol>.  The .RS command no longer ends a
  .IP or .TP entry.  Correct .Ql so it doesn't generate spurious 
  line breaks. Fix a bug in <group> syntax processing.  Declare <envar>
  <constant>, and <errorcode> in-line tags (avoids fooups in processing 
  mdoc). Fix lexer bug that dropped a character after triple-quote in tokens.
  Evaluate groff-style \\n[...] register escapes, \\n(.$., \w, and .g.
  Generate IDs correctly even when section titles are in CJK.  Accept
  options starting with +. The mdoc interpreter can now deal with an
  out-of-order Synopsis section. This version lifts 94% of 9829 manual
  pages in a full Red Hat 9 installation with Fedora updates.

1.0.5 @ 2003-10-21
  Translate Version 8 .L macro and friends.  Fix some minor markup
  problems in doclifter.xml.

  effort is now made to identify markup that refers to section headers
  and lift it to link tags (by Aaron Hawley).  Corrected erroneous
  handling of string quotes around request arguments.  Implemented
  mdoc .Ex and .Rv macros.  Better handling of \d, \u, and \v troff
  requests.

  Enable translation of PIC diagrams using pic2plot. Lift highlighted 
  .*_t and errno appropriately.  Implemented .fam and \F groff
  extensions.  Improved synopsis line detection.  Interpret DS/DE in
  manual pages (it's illegal but unambiguous).  Work around common
  error of putting an opening ' at the left margin. This version lifts 
  96% of 6705 manual pages in a Red Hat 8.0 install.

1.0.2 @ 2003-02-13
  Corrected a bug in processing of the .SM highlight on manual pages.
  This affects other font changers with two-character names, notably CW.

1.0.1 @ 2002-09-17
  Prevent some false matches on mwww macros.  Don't generate 
  entity inclusion files into the internal set; Tim Waugh says
  it's not necessary and indeed it seems not to be when I'm using xmlto.

1.0.0 @ 2002-08-17
  Better firewalling against unbalanced font changes -- unbalanced
  markup can no longer break the translation. Drastically 
  improved parsing of function prototypes. Support for mwww macros.
  Added groff-1.18's euro and micro signs.  Also now interpreting
  various historical fossils from Ultrix and elsewhere that show up

0.95 @ 2002-07-15
  Point release for Pradeep Padala.
  Added Windows port fix. Better command marking from synopsis 
  sections.  Oops, allow tildes in URLs.  We can handle multiple
  stacked .TP entries now.  Implement groff mso, ignore ftr.
  Crude, non-semantic lifting of function synopses.

0.9 @ 2001-11-09 
  Add mm support.  Resolve Latin 1 and Latin 2 entities correctly.  
  Don't let line numbering be confused by saved sections.  Handle
