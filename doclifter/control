Package: doclifter

Description: lift documents in nroff markups to XML-DocBook
 Lifting documents from presentation level to semantic level is hard,
 and a really good job requires human polishing.  This tool aims to do
 everything that can be mechanized, and to preserve any troff-level
 information that might have structural implications in XML comments.
 This tool does the hard parts.  TBL tables are translated into DocBook
 table markup, PIC into SVG, and EQN into MathML (relying on pic2svg
 and GNU eqn for the last two).
